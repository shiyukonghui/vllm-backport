"""
LRU capacity manager for the file system KV offload tier.

The fs tier has no inherent size bound: every offloaded chunk becomes a file
and nothing ever deletes them. FsCapacityManager tracks the tier's chunk files
in an LRU ordering and, once total size exceeds ``capacity_bytes``, unlinks
least-recently-used files until usage drops below
``capacity_bytes * watermark``.

Concurrency model: all mutating calls happen on the scheduler thread (the
tier's ``submit_store`` / ``touch`` / ``get_finished_jobs`` are only invoked
from there), so a plain dict suffices; a lock is kept for safety against
future callers. Actual ``unlink`` latency is metadata-only and small, and each
call to :meth:`evict` is bounded by ``max_evictions_per_step``.

Load-race protection: a file can be looked up (HIT) and then evicted before
the load job runs, which would fail the load. Files whose keys were recently
touched or stored are protected from eviction for ``protect_s`` seconds.

Restart behavior: the index is rebuilt by scanning ``scan_dirs`` at startup,
seeding recency from file mtimes, so the LRU ordering survives restarts
approximately.
